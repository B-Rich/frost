# Frost <small>Web Framework</small>

Frost is a full featured MVC Web Framework for the
[Crystal programming language](http://crystal-lang.org), largely inspired by
Ruby on Rails (ie. implements most of its API).

Frost is to Ruby on Rails what Crystal is to Ruby: similar API, developer
hapiness and productivity come first, but enhanced with static typing (mostly
hidden) and incredible performance.

**WARNING**: Frost is in _developer preview_, and must be considered alpha
software until further notice. Features may be added, dropped, tweaked, or
changed dramatically at any time. Please experiment with Frost, contribute to
Frost, let's make it incredbile, but build software out of it at your own risk!


## Usage

Frost mostly feels like Rails, but comes with differences and limitations here
and there. Check the [guides](guides/GETTING_STARTED.html) to feel the framework,
then check the [documentation](http://docrystal.org/github.com/ysbaddaden/frost).
